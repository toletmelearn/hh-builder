/**
 * Drop-in replacement for the AI SDK's default `Output.text()` that avoids an
 * O(n^2) cost in `streamText`'s `fullStream`.
 *
 * `streamText` always pipes `fullStream` through `createOutputTransformStream`.
 * With no `output` configured it defaults to `Output.text()`, whose
 * `parsePartialOutput` returns the whole accumulated text as `partial`. On every
 * text-delta the transform then runs `JSON.stringify(partial)` and diffs it
 * against the previous value to decide whether to emit a `partialOutput`, so
 * that stringify+diff is O(n) per chunk, O(n^2) over a long response. On large
 * multi-file generations this saturates the main process's JS thread and
 * freezes the app.
 *
 * We read `fullStream` parts directly and never consume `partialOutput`, so the
 * work is pure waste. This returns an O(1) value that still changes every chunk
 * (the text length), which keeps text flushing incrementally while making the
 * per-chunk work O(1). (Returning `undefined` would instead make text flush only
 * at block end, breaking streaming.) `responseFormat` is unchanged, so the model
 * request is identical.

/**
 * Cancel the orphaned `baseStream` tee branch the AI SDK leaves behind

 * Reading `.fullStream` runs the SDK's `teeStream()` synchronously: it
 * splits the SDK's internal `baseStream` into two branches and
 * reassigns the unread branch back onto `streamResult.baseStream`.
 * WhatWG `tee()` enqueues every upstream chunk into both branches'
 * controllers regardless of whether they have a reader, so the unread
 * branch's queue grows unbounded as the model streams — the dominant
 * in-flight memory leak observed in heap snapshots (`{part,
 * partialOutput}` objects parked in a `ReadableStreamDefaultController`
 * queue, rooted via the undici connection pool).
 *
 * Call this immediately after reading `.fullStream` and before the
 * stream begins pumping chunks. The cancel runs before any chunks are
 * pumped, so the orphan controller closes immediately and future
 * enqueues to it are no-ops.

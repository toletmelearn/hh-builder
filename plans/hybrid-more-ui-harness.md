# Plan: migrate UI-driven e2e specs to the hybrid harness (ChatPanel + beyond)

Goal: migrate every e2e spec whose behavior the hybrid vitest harness can
drive through **the real trigger UI**, keeping the harness's deep assertions
(LLM payloads, db rows, files, git log). Two groups:

- **ChatPanel-side (22 specs)** — the trigger UI already mounts today; 12 need
  zero harness work, 10 need a named extension (Phase CP2 table below).
- **Beyond-ChatPanel (17 specs)** — the trigger UI lives in the title bar,
  settings pages, or connector panels; needs the Phase 0 surface extensions.

Delivery model: land this as **one large consolidated PR**, not lots of little
PRs. Use reviewable sections or commits inside that single PR, but do not open
phase-by-phase, family-by-family, or spec-by-spec PRs. Keep Phase 0/1/2/3
progress on the same branch and keep updating the same PR as additional
families migrate. Each migrated e2e spec is deleted or slimmed in the same PR as
its replacement integration coverage.

Beyond-ChatPanel flows, grouped by the surface that must become mountable:

| Family                         | Specs                                                                                                                                         | New surface(s)                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title-bar / app-list / dialogs | `copy_app`, `delete_app`, `rename_app`, `switch_apps`, `new_chat`                                                                             | TitleBar + `/app-details` page (+ ChatList / home-lite)                                                     |
| Settings / dialog pages        | `telemetry`, `max_tool_call_steps`, `smart_context_options`, `turbo_edits_options`, `dyad_pro_key_validation`, `supabase_migrations` (toggle) | settings page sections / standalone settings components + `/settings/providers/$provider`                   |
| Publish / connector panels     | `github`, `github-import`, `git_collaboration`, `neon_branch`, `neon_migration`, `media_library`                                              | GitHub/Neon connectors (via `/app-details`), ImportAppDialog, DatabaseSection/MigrationPanel, `/media` page |

## Phase CP1 — ChatPanel specs ready NOW (12; no harness work, can start before Phase 0)

These drive surfaces the harness already mounts (chat input, message cards,
banners, queue header, aux menus). Same migration discipline as everything
else: keep the expect-by-expect migration checklist, delete each e2e spec in
the same consolidated PR as its replacement, and group the work into reviewable
commits/sections instead of many small PRs. Where a spec has a case outside
ChatPanel, the case that stays e2e is named here explicitly.

| Spec                           | Drive / assert                                                                                                | Stays e2e                                       |

| `local_agent_consent.spec.ts`  | consent banner, Always/Once/Decline buttons + message snapshots                                               | —                                               |

| `notification_banner.spec.ts`  | in-chat notification-tip banner dismiss/enable + settings delta                                               | native-notification guide dialog case           |
| `pause_queue.spec.ts`          | queue header pause/resume/paused state (queue processor mounts in the harness as of the step-limit migration) | —                                               |
| `plan_mode.spec.ts`            | accept-plan buttons, questionnaire, mode selector, plan file on disk                                          | plan annotations / View-Plan PreviewPanel cases |
| `streaming_renderer.spec.ts`   | streamed dyad-write block rendering + pending indicators                                                      | —                                               |
| `theme_selection.spec.ts`      | chat-input themes menu, selection + settings persistence                                                      | home-page variant                               |
| `voice_to_text.spec.ts`        | mic button pro-gating/enabled states in chat input                                                            | real getUserMedia recording case                |

**Deliverables**: 12 integration tests; 6 e2e specs deleted outright, 6
slimmed to their named remaining case(s).

## Phase CP2 — ChatPanel specs needing an extension first (10)

Each row names the blocking extension and where it lives in this plan. Three
of the five extensions are already scoped by Phase 0 (0.1/0.3/0.4); only 0.6
and 0.7 are new work items.

| Spec                                                                                                              | Blocking extension                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mcp.spec.ts`, `mcp_auto_consent.spec.ts`, `mcp_out_of_order.spec.ts`, `local_agent_advanced.spec.ts` (MCP cases) | **covered** by `harness.mcp` helpers that seed stdio/http fake MCP servers through the real `mcp:*` IPC handlers and drive consent/tool cards through real ChatPanel UI      |

| `chat_image_generation.spec.ts`                                                                                   | **covered** by the existing `/chat` mount and auxiliary-actions dropdown drivers                                                                                             |

### 0.6 MCP fake-server bootstrapping (new)

Implemented as `harness.mcp` in
`src/testing/hybrid_chat_harness.tsx`. It creates/deletes MCP server rows
through the real `mcp:*` IPC handlers, waits for live tool discovery through
`mcp:list-tools`, uses the same `testing/fake-stdio-mcp-server.mjs` stdio server
the e2e suite used, and spawns `testing/fake-http-mcp-server.mjs` on an
ephemeral loopback port for HTTP transport coverage. HTTP child processes are
tracked and killed during harness teardown.

The fake LLM server's MCP auto-consent classifier shortcut now exists on both
responses and chat-completions paths, so local-agent classifier tests exercise
the same safe/destructive decisions regardless of which fake model route the
harness-selected engine model uses.

### 0.7 Attachment injection via the bridge (new)

A harness helper that seeds attachments the way the real file-picker handoff
does (bridge-level injection into the chat input's attachment state), so
attachment-carrying prompts can be sent through the real submit path. Unlocks
2 specs.

Implemented as `harness.setChatAttachments([{ name, content, mimeType, type }])`
in `src/testing/hybrid_chat_harness.tsx`. It writes browser `File` objects into
`attachmentsAtom`, leaving submit, queueing, `FileReader` conversion, IPC stream
params, and `.dyad/media` persistence on the real production path. The harness
also exposes `setSelectedComponents` for queue edit/restore assertions that only
need ChatInput state; real iframe component picking stays in E2E.

**Migrated CP2 coverage so far**: `mcp.spec.ts`,
`mcp_auto_consent.spec.ts`, `mcp_out_of_order.spec.ts`, and the MCP cases from
`local_agent_advanced.spec.ts` are covered in
`src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/mcp.integration.test.tsx`, which seeds stdio and
HTTP MCP servers via production IPC, drives build-mode MCP consent/tool cards,
asserts merged out-of-order parallel tool cards, exercises local-agent MCP
auto-consent safe/destructive/manual/pending-classifier paths, and renders MCP
tool-search/schema cards in forced search mode. The fully migrated MCP e2e specs
and their snapshots are deleted; `local_agent_advanced.spec.ts` is slimmed to
its remaining non-MCP cases. `chat_image_generation.spec.ts` is covered in
`src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/chat_image_generation.integration.test.tsx`, which
drives the chat auxiliary-actions dropdown -> real `ImageGeneratorDialog` ->
real `generate-image` IPC handler against the fake engine image endpoint, then
asserts the generated media file, enabled send button with no text input,
composer thumbnail dismissal, rendered sent-message image attachment, and DB
message attachment tag. `version_search.spec.ts` is covered in
`src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/version_search.integration.test.tsx`, which drives
`ChatHeader` -> `VersionPane` through the existing `/chat` mount and asserts
version-number/message/note search, empty results, clear, favorite-only
filtering, note persistence, favorite persistence, and close/reopen reset
behavior. `local_agent_large_attachment.spec.ts` is covered in
`src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/local_agent_large_attachment.integration.test.tsx`,
which seeds a large text attachment into the real ChatInput attachment atom,
sends the prompt through the real local-agent submit path, asserts the rendered
MustardScript card reads `attachments:large-log.txt`, and verifies the stored
attachment manifest entry. The attachment restore case from
`queued_message.spec.ts` is covered in
`src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/queued_message.integration.test.tsx`, which queues a
message during a real stream, restores its seeded attachment and selected
component while editing, clears both on submit, and lets the queue drain through
the real processor. `supabase_stale_ui.spec.ts` is covered in
`src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/supabase_stale_ui.integration.test.tsx`, which
connects Supabase for one app through the real app-details connector, navigates
the same mounted route to a second app, and asserts the first app's connected
project card does not leak into the second app's setup UI.
`e2e-tests/chat_image_generation.spec.ts`,
`e2e-tests/version_search.spec.ts`,
`e2e-tests/local_agent_large_attachment.spec.ts`, and
`e2e-tests/supabase_stale_ui.spec.ts` are deleted on the same consolidated
migration PR. `e2e-tests/queued_message.spec.ts` is slimmed to the remaining
non-attachment queue and real-preview component-selection coverage.

## 0. Current state and the extension point

`setupHybridChatHarness` (`src/testing/hybrid_chat_harness.tsx`) already runs
**every** main-process IPC handler (`registerIpcHandlers()` — the same call
`main.ts` makes), a real sqlite db, a real git checkout, the real fake-LLM
server, and a real `window.electron` bridge. The only thing that is
chat-specific is `mount()`: it builds a **private route tree with a single
`/chat` route** rendering `<ChatPanel>` inside QueryClient + Jotai + Theme +
Toaster scaffolding (lines ~335–400).

So the work is almost entirely **renderer-side**: mount more surfaces over the
already-real IPC stack. `copy-app`, `delete-app`, `rename-app`, `create-chat`,
`github:*`, `neon:*`, `media:*`, `set-user-settings`, `validate-provider-api-key`
handlers are all registered today; the buttons that call them just aren't
rendered.

Verified constraints to design around (from the component mapping):

1. **No native OS dialogs anywhere in the 17 flows' core paths.** The only
   native pickers nearby (`select-app-location` folder move, ImportAppDialog's
   "Local Folder" tab, `selectAppFolder`) are outside or severable from these
   flows. `openExternalUrl` appears in several places but is fire-and-forget.
2. **`E2E_TEST_BUILD` / `FAKE_LLM_PORT` are not set by the harness today**
   (verified: no reference in `src/testing/*`). GitHub handlers
   (`src/ipc/handlers/github_handlers.ts` ~L67–80) and the Neon mock client
   (`src/neon_admin/neon_management_client.ts` `getNeonClient()` L98) both gate
   on `IS_TEST_BUILD` (= `E2E_TEST_BUILD === "true"`, read at **import time**)
   and route to `http://localhost:${FAKE_LLM_PORT}/github/...` / an in-process
   mock. The harness's fake server already serves the `/github/*` routes
   (`testing/fake-llm-server/githubHandler.ts`).
3. **The i18n mock renders raw keys** (`src/testing/hybrid.setup.ts`:
   `t: (key, fallback) => typeof fallback === "string" ? fallback : key`).
   Several target components select by translated text in e2e
   (e.g. "Copy app with history", `ai.maxToolCallSteps` combobox name).
4. **Import-graph hazards are real and precedented**: mounting `ChatPage`
   instead of `ChatPanel` hangs on Monaco/iframe (HYBRID_HARNESS.md §7).
   `PublishPanel` lives in `src/components/preview_panel/` — same risk class.
   Every new surface needs an import audit before it's blessed.
5. Measured cost of hybrid tests: ~2–4s fixed per file (collect + harness
   boot), ~0.3–1.2s per test. Adding surfaces mostly adds collect time; keep
   surface mounts narrow so unrelated files don't pay for it.

Design principles (carried over from the existing harness):

- **Real handlers, never mocked IPC.** If a flow needs a fake, it's the same
  fake e2e uses (fake-llm-server routes, `IS_TEST_BUILD` mock Neon,
  `neon:fake-connect`). We do not stub `ipc.*` client methods.
- **One harness per test file**, forks pool, unchanged.
- **Harness edits only in this plan's Phase 0/first-use commits** — migrated
  tests themselves must not patch the harness (CHAT_FLOW_HARNESS.md rule).
- Prefer `data-testid`/`aria-label` selectors; where a spec's identity depends
  on user-visible text, fix the i18n mock (Phase 0.4) instead of weakening the
  selector.

---

## Phase 0 — core harness extensions (prerequisite for all families)

### 0.1 `mountSurface()` + a multi-route private tree

Extend `mount()`'s scaffolding into a reusable `mountSurface(opts)`:

```ts
harness.mountSurface({
  route: "/app-details", // one of the registered test routes
  search: { appId: harness.appId }, // validated by the REAL route schema
  withTitleBar: true, // wrap in a layout that renders <TitleBar/>
});
```

- Build the route tree from the union of surfaces we support, each importing
  the **real** `validateSearch` schema from its route module the way `/chat`
  imports `chatSearchSchema` (and, like `chatSearchSchema`, split schemas out
  of route files whose static imports drag in preview/Monaco — audit first):
  - `/` (home-lite — see 1.5), `/chat` (existing), `/app-details`
    (`AppDetailsPage` from `src/pages/app-details.tsx`), `/settings`
    (`src/pages/settings.tsx`), `/settings/providers/$provider`
    (`ProviderSettingsPage`), `/media` (`src/pages/media.tsx`).
  - Routes are **registered lazily per mount** (only the surface a test asks
    for, plus navigation targets it declares) so a settings test doesn't
    collect the app-details import graph.
- Optional layout route rendering the real `<TitleBar/>` above `<Outlet/>` so
  flows that start with `title-bar-app-name-button` → navigate → app-details
  run the true entry path (TitleBar needs `selectedAppIdAtom` + `list-apps`,
  both already live).
- Keep the existing `mount()` as a thin alias for
  `mountSurface({ route: "/chat" })` — zero churn for existing tests.
- Expose `harness.router` / `harness.currentLocation()` so tests can assert
  post-action navigation (delete-app → `/`, copy-app "Open in Chat" → `/chat`)
  against the memory history.
- Add provider shims to the scaffolding, gated per surface: `SidebarProvider`
  (TelemetryBanner calls `useSidebar()`), `TooltipProvider`, and the DeepLink
  provider (`useDeepLink` — required by `NeonConnector`).

### 0.2 `testBuild: true` option (GitHub/Neon fakes)

New harness option that, **after** the fake server has bound its ephemeral
port and **before** the dynamic `await import("@/ipc/ipc_host")`:

- sets `process.env.E2E_TEST_BUILD = "true"` and
  `process.env.FAKE_LLM_PORT = <fake server port>`;
- snapshots/restores both on `dispose()` (same pattern as
  `DYAD_SKIP_MANAGED_PNPM_INSTALL`).

This is sufficient because `github_handlers` / `neon_management_client` read
the flags at module import, and `ipc_host` is only imported dynamically inside
setup. It unlocks: fake GitHub device flow + repo/push routes, test-only
endpoints (`/github/api/test/push-events`, `/clear-push-events`,
`/reset-repos` — expose small `harness.github.*` fetch helpers over
`fakeLlmUrl`), the in-process mock Neon client, and the `neon:fake-connect`
handler. Renderer modules must be audited for their own import-time reads of
these flags (none known today; the guard smoke test in 0.5 catches drift).

### 0.3 Dialog / popover / menu drivers

happy-dom needs the same coaxing for Radix/Base UI popups that
`selectFromBaseUiSelect` already implements. Add:

- `openPopover(trigger)` / `clickMenuItem(name)` — pointerDown/Up + click +
  keyboard fallback, used for the app-details more-options popover, media
  thumbnail action menus, branch-actions menus.
- `confirmDialog(matcher)` / `findDialog(matcher)` — wait for
  `role="dialog"`/`"alertdialog"`, click a named action, wait for close.
- `setSwitch(labelOrTestId, on)` — Radix `Switch` driver (supabase migrations
  toggle, github auto-sync).

Each helper lands with the first test that needs it, in the harness file, with
a cookbook entry in HYBRID_HARNESS.md.

### 0.4 i18n mock upgrade

Replace the passthrough `t` in `src/testing/hybrid.setup.ts` with one that
synchronously loads the real `src/i18n/locales/en/*.json` resources (key
lookup + `{{var}}` interpolation; fall back to key). This makes user-visible
text selectors ("Copy app with history", "Write SQL migration files",
"Max Tool Calls (Agent)") work identically to production and removes a whole
class of silent selector drift. Existing tests keep passing (keys they relied
on either resolve to the same string or they used testids).

### 0.5 Per-surface guard tests

For each new surface, a tiny `*.integration.test.tsx` that mounts it and
asserts (a) it renders its landmark testid, (b) no missing-channel failures at
dispose (already enforced), (c) the Monaco/iframe modules were not loaded
(same class of guard as `hybrid_chat_harness.guard.integration.test.tsx`).
This is the cheap tripwire for import-graph regressions.

**Exit criteria for Phase 0**: guard tests green for `/app-details` and
`/settings`; `mount()` alias keeps all 16 existing hybrid tests byte-identical
green; `testBuild: true` smoke proves a `github:start-flow` round trip against
the fake server.

## Phase 1 — title-bar / app-list / dialog family

All five flows confirmed native-dialog-free. Entry: `mountSurface({ route:
"/app-details", search: { appId }, withTitleBar: true })`.

### 1.5 `switch_apps` / home-lite

The real flow runs through `home.tsx` + `HomeChatInput` (heaviest mount:
streaming hooks + Lexical + several home atoms). Two-step approach:

1. First land `switch_apps` by creating the second app through the real
   `create-app` handler + `useSelectChat`-equivalent seeding, then assert the
   **UI switch** via TitleBar/app-details mounts (this covers the spec's
   actual assertions, which are app-identity, not home-page rendering).
2. Promote to a real home-route mount only if/when other home-driven specs
   (`home_chat_existing_app` etc.) justify a `HomeChatInput` surface; that is
   explicitly out of scope here.

**Deliverables**: `copy_app`, `delete_app`, `rename_app`, `new_chat`,
`switch_apps` as `*.integration.test.tsx`; delete the five e2e specs. Covered
in `src/ipc/handlers/__tests__/app_details_actions.integration.test.tsx` on the
single consolidated migration PR.

## Phase 2 — settings / dialog pages family

All six flows funnel through `set-user-settings`; assert on the harness's real
settings file plus the rendered control state. Mount targets are deliberately
narrow — a standalone component where the spec never leaves it, the settings
page only where section context matters.

| Spec                           | Mount                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Phase 3 — publish / connector panels family

Requires `testBuild: true` (0.2). Mount connectors via `/app-details` (they
render there in production) — **not** via `PublishPanel` until its
`preview_panel` import graph passes the 0.5 guard; `DatabaseSection` /
`MigrationPanelBody` are imported directly to sidestep that initially.

## Out of scope (stays Playwright regardless)

Native folder pickers (`selectAppFolder`, `select-app-location`), real
`openExternalUrl` browser handoff, preview-iframe behaviors, aria/visual
snapshots of full-app layout, Lexical keystroke fidelity, and the home-page
`HomeChatInput` surface (revisit only with a dedicated plan).

## Sequencing

Ship this as **one consolidated PR**, not a series of many small PRs. Keep the
phases as the internal implementation and review order, with commits/sections
that make the large diff navigable. Phase checkpoints may be pushed for review,
but they should update the same PR instead of creating new PRs:

1. **Phase 0** (harness core) first; no spec deletions until the harness guard
   tests are green and the existing hybrid tests still pass.
2. **Phase 1** next; delete the title-bar/app-list/dialog e2e specs in the same
   consolidated PR as their integration replacements.
3. **Phase 2** can proceed once 0.1/0.4 are in place (no `testBuild`
   dependency except pro-key validation, which needs only the existing
   `engine: true`).
4. **Phase 3** follows 0.2; `github` first (proves device flow + fake routes),
   then `git_collaboration` (reuses it), then neon pair, `media_library`,
   `github-import` last (dialog-direct mount is independent).

Before requesting final review on the consolidated PR, run the full relevant
verification once across the final combined diff: existing hybrid tests, new
guard tests, and every migrated integration spec. The PR description should
include the migration checklist mapping each removed e2e assertion to its new
integration assertion or named keep/drop note.

Beyond-ChatPanel end state: 16 of the 17 specs fully deleted from
`e2e-tests/`, `media_library` slimmed to its single named remnant, and every
migrated flow driven through the same clicks a user makes — with
payload/db/git/file assertions the Playwright versions never had.
